## Lifespan
Isopods will live for 1.5-2 years on average.  
Baby isopods are very small, about 1 millimeter, and will molt within 24 hours.  
They will then molt in the next 2 weeks and then a third time in the third week.  
They will most less frequently as they get older.  
Full grown isopods are less than 2cm in length with most species being smaller.  
Lone isopods tend to have a shorter lifespan which may indicate a reliance on social structures and group activities.  

For most species, sexes are separate with little sexual differences.  
Some species are exempt from this where the organism has traits of both.  
Others will start their life as males/females and change their sex to female/male.  
Identifying an isopod's sex can be difficult to determine without observing them mate.  
Males have a pair of penises that can be fused in some species.  
Females will store their eggs in a white brood pouch under their body that is relatively large.  
$\quad$ This is still difficult to see unless the isopod is observed on its back and close up.  
The baby isopods will love and grow here for about 40-50 days.  
The number of babies can vary from 10 to 70 and a female can have 1-3 groups of babies a year.  

The mating process includes the isopods touching their antenna with each other and then getting on top of the other isopod.  
The male is the one that approached the female and initialized the contact.  


## Body Features
Terrestrial isopods have hard segmented exoskeletons composed of three body parts.  
The first body part is the head which features two compound eyes, two sets of antennae (small & large), and mouth parts for manipulating and chewing food.  
The second body part is the thorax which features seven sets of jointing walking legs of equal size.  
The third body part is the abdomen.  
Some special of terrestrial isopods will have two small appendages called uropods that stick out from the end of the body.  


## Living Environment
Terrestrial isopods live in the moist leaf litter and top layer of soil in most urban and natural environments.  
If their environment is dry, they will die earlier as moisture is very important to their survival.  
If an isopod falls into a water and cannot get out, they will drown.  


## Resource Consumption
While individual isopods won't eat that much individually, a group will consistently clear rotting organic material until it is exhausted.  
In general, terrestrial species are detritivores; they primarily eat dead plants and animals.  
Plant Food resources:  
- Leaf litter
- Decaying plant life
- Fruits and Vegetables
- Fungi
- Bark

Isopods can get water from drinking it, from the food they eat, absorbing it from the atmosphere, and absorbing it through their anus.  

Isopods breath oxygen through white gill-like organs on the back underside of their body.  
If you flip an isopod onto its abdomen, you will see these organs as two white dots.  


## Locomotion
Most terrestrial species are slow-moving with crawling as their primary mode of locomotion.  
Most species can also roll themselves into a ball when threatened.  
For the species that cannot roll into a ball, they tend to crawl much faster in general.  


## Other Potential Animals
Snails
Millipedes
Springtails (reduce mold)
Worm (no biological benefit)
